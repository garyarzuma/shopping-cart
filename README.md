# shopping-cart

A multi-page e-commerce website clone of the Teddy Fresh clothing line done using React, Context API, and React Router. Images were taken from Teddy Fresh and this is for education purposes only....dont come after me H3.

Features:

    -Multiple webpages for a fun home screen welcome, products page of beautiful hoodies, and shopping cart to see what goods you will soon get. Checkout feature coming soon!
    -Add Hoodies to your cart and specify the exact quantity to add.
    -Delete items from you cart if you get buyers remorse!

Demonstrated Skills:

    -Focues on the Context API of React to control the main state of the shopping. All components derive the shopping cart state from this to avoid needless and messy passing of props between components.
    -Uses React Router to control the links and flow of multiple webpages in the site.
    -Uses React Hooks like useState, useReducer, and useEffect to handle initialization and life cycle methods.
    -Uses the create-react-app to start the backbone of this project.
    -Uses React.js to handle all of the frontend using states, props and components with function based components.

Future Ways to Improve:

    -Add a checkout button and integrate a paypal payment system. Don't actually scam people though...

Overall project time: ~20 hours
